# Fun-Bot
This is a discord bot with a ton of fun commands to have in your server! (This bot is unfinished)
- Type =help to view a list of commands
- Most commands will either reward or remove points
- Points can go negative because whether you have enough points or not, you can always use the commands. 
- Sending messages will give you +0.25 points and sending images will give you +0.50 points
- Adds 1 point for every minute the user's in a vc (i suggest having an afk channel so they can't abuse this)
